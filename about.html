        <p>Will Goodon has built a career with a combination of community service and entrepreneurship. Tutored by his parents to look for opportunities in business, Will also seized the calling of working for the Metis Nation in the Metis Government in various capacities. </p>
		  
        <p>Partnering with his father, Will is currently a co-owner of both the Canadian Wilderness Inn in Boissevain and the Killarney Wilderness Inn in Killarney.</p>
		  
        <p>Will also continues to work for Metis Governments as a facilitator, consultant and assembly chair. He has chaired assemblies for many years for the Metis National Council, Manitoba Metis Federation, Metis Nation - Saskatchewan and Metis Nation British Columbia. He has chaired dozens of conferences and assemblies throughout the Metis Nation Homeland.</p>
		  
		<p>He has also recently spoken out publicly on the Metis Nation Homeland Map and the need to protect the Metis Nation citizenship from those who would commit identity theft.</p>
		  
		<p>Will had the honour of being the Chair of his local - the Cherry Creek Metis Council - for several years, in addition to the Southwest Regional Metis Centre Board. </p>
		  
		<p>He grew up in the Southwest Region, in the Turtle Mountains and was taught Metis heritage by his father, Irvin Goodon.  The two of them still go out on the trapline and hunt for ducks and deer for food.</p>
		  
		<p>In 2004, Will was duck hunting in our region and was charged for hunting waterfowl without a provincially issued license.  Will asserted that his MMF Metis Harvesterâ€™s Card identified him as a Metis Citizen with hunting rights.  The Province of Manitoba took Will to court and in 2009 when the verdict was read by Judge Combs, Metis in Manitoba had their rights recognized at last.</p>
		  
		<p>Will also follows the local minor hockey scene and gymnastics meets with his son, Hunter, and daughter, Taylor who are active in competitive sports. 

Will, along with his partner, Kelly, and children, Hunter and Taylor, live on an acreage south of Brandon, Manitoba.
 
Will was elected as a Provincial Board member representing the Southwest Region on June 26, 2014 and was re-elected in 2018.</p>
